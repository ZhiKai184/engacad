        <p>(Overall design period: 29th March 2021 ~ 5th April 2021)</p>
        <p>In this section, I have decided to split into 2 phases to better document my experience with using Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML). They are the “Learning” and “Execution” phase.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>1. "Learning" phase:</h3></li>
          <p>(Phase period: 29th March 2021 ~ 30th March 2021)</p>
          <p>During this phase, I started to learn the basics of HTML. I watched Jake Wright’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk&list=LL&index=4&t=1s">"Learn HTML in 12 Minutes”</a> and had understood the basic structure of HTML, indentations and the important tags such as, head, body, title and html.. Upon watching his video, I had applied what he had thought me by creating a test website on Visual Studio Code, a text editor.</p>
          <p>Here is the HTML code that I had crafted while watching his video:</p>
          <img src="images/learning-phase_html_code.PNG" class="learning-phase_html_code" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>Here is how my test website looked like:</p>
        <img src="images/learning-phase_html_webpage.PNG" class="learning-phase_html_webpage" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>However, I did not stop there. I carried on and watch Jake Wright’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ13lX20FqU&list=LL&index=3">“Learn More HTML in 12 Minutes”</a>. From there, I had learnt about the div element, classes, paragraphs, headings from h1 to h 6, and new tags like, span. </p>
        <p>Again, I did not stop there and I continued to learn more about HTML by watching a playlist from LearnCode.academy on Youtube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQojMIhELvM&list=PLoYCgNOIyGABDU532eesybur5HPBVfC1G">“2019 Web Development Tutorials For Beginners”</a>.</p>
        <p>Through his playlist, I had learnt more HTML and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) [discussed later]. Not only have I leant new tags like ul, ol, li, but also, tricks to speed up my web development process. For instance, I had learnt to use the live server to have a real-time view of my website as I code. Furthermore, I had also learnt to use 2 windows at the same time  to look at my code as well as to look at the live view of my website.</p>
        <p>Here is a screenshot of my screen when I open live server and open 2 separate windows:</p>
        <img src="images/split_window.PNG" class="split_window" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <li><h3>2. "Execution" phase:</h3></li>
          <p>(Phase period: 31st March 2021 ~ 5th April 2021)</p>
          <p>During this phase, I started structuring the layout of this website. I used tags like, header and footer and classes such as .sidebar and .main. I had also plan on what content to included for the “Home” page followed by “About” page and the “Project” pages. After, I had come with with a layout for the “Home” page, using CSS (dicussed later), I begin to come up with the contents for the webpages. As the “Home” page is the first page to be displayed, I first focused on the content for that page.</p>
          <p>To ensure that I do not make too many edits on my text editor for the contents and also not make too many grammatical errors, I structured and typed out the contents on Google Doc. As soon as I am done with organising and coming up with the content, I copied the text in the Google Doc and pasted it into the text editor.</p>
          <p>Here is a screenshot of how I planned my content on Google Doc:</p>
          <img src="images/google-doc_html.PNG" class="google-doc_html" alt="">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
          <p>After I am done with the contents for the “Home” page, I moved on to the “About” page and finally the respective “Projects” pages.</p>
          <p>In terms of making the web pages look needed throughout, I used the horizontal line element and other elements. I had also linked the list of contents so that the web page will scroll to the respective heading when the link is clicked.This idea came from a website for Digital Fabrication.</p>
          <p>Overall, I feel that HTML is not too complicated as it sounds. Being familiar with the tags, classes, elements and the structure requires learning from online videos and trial and error.</p>

        <h2 id="Experience with CSS">Experience with CSS</h2>
        <p>(Overall design period: 30th March 2021 ~ 5th April 2021)</p>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>1. “Learning” phase:</h3></li>
          <p>(Phase period: 30th March 2021 ~ 31th March 2021)</p>
          <p>In this phase, I started learning about CSS by watching Jake Wright’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE&list=LL&index=7">“Learn CSS in 12 Minutes”</a>. After watching his video, I learnt the importance of sketching a layout of your webpage on a piece of paper before jumping straight into coding in CSS.This enables us to see the big picture of what we are trying to design.</p>
          <p>Aside from learning the importance of sketching a layout on a piece of paper, I had also learnt how to use div elements and classes in CSS, the syntax  and how to design using CSS properties such as text-align, float, padding and colour.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier under “Experience with HTML - 1. “Learning” phase:” , I had also learnt more above CSS from “2019 Web Development Tutorials For Beginners”. I had learnt additional CSS properties like flexbox and how to create multiple web pages.</p>
          <p>Once I had watched the above mentioned videos, I decided not to use Jake Wright’s web page template as I want to challenge myself by designing a new template.</p>
          <p>Here is a sketch for the “Home” page:</p>
          <img src="images/webpage_sketch_home.jpeg" class="webpage_sketch_home" alt="">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
          <li><h3>2. “Execution” phase:</h3></li>
          <p>(Phase period: 1st April 2021 ~ 5th April 2021)</p>
          <p>Once I had come up with a sketch, I started working on the sidebars. As I am still new to CSS, I looked for tutorials on how to make a sidebar. From there, I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-pil5oHw0w">Youtube video</a> from "Code Snow" where they demonstrate to viewers how to design a decent looking web page using CSS.Instead of copying every single detail of the code, I made modifications throughout my code so that I get to learn something rather than blindly copying. Though the process is long, I eventually managed to design the sidebar, header and body of the web page through trial and error.</p>
          <p>As for the footer and the usage of a div with the id being "content", it is being incorporated from Jake Wright’s website template.</p>
          <p>To take a step further, I decided to design  dropdowns for my sidebar. I learned to do so by watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsHhKpR1ItA&list=LL&index=10">Youtube video</a> from "JDB ART". This has been a bit of a challenge as the semantics of the code from that video is a bit different from mine and I had to spend some time to figure out how to accomplish designing the dropdowns. Eventually, I managed to successfully create the dropdowns. The reason why I wanted to design the dropdowns is not only because I want to improve the user experience, but also to keep the contents in the “Projects” pages organised.</p>
          <P>Finally, I had included a scroll top button. Surprisingly, the process of creating the scroll top button was smooth thanks to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vef9bxTilCU&list=LL&index=9">Youtube video</a> from "Dark Code".</P>
          <p>Once I am done with the layout design, I copy and paste the source code from index.html to other files.</p>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="Experience with Git">Experience with Git</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, I did not manage to use Git as I find that using GitHub Desktop is much more suitable for me. This is because I am not accustomed to writing on command lines and it is not very intuitive. Nevertheless, I will watch tutorials on how to use Git and document my experience when I am free.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="Git vs. GitHub desktop">Git vs. GitHub desktop:</h2>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, I personaly prefer using GitHub desktop than using Git. Using GitHub Desktop is much more easier due to its Graphical User Interface (GUI). Setting up requires cloning a chosen repository from GitHub. Before starting to edit files, make sure to always <strong>Fetch</strong> origin in case there are updates to the file. Then after editing, you have to <strong>Save</strong> your files so that the things you changed will be reflected. Then, type in a summary on the changes have you made and <strong>Commit</strong> to main. Once done, remember to <strong>Push</strong> origin or else the changes will not be updated. These are the few steps to follow when using GitHub Desktop for Version Control.</p>
