        <h2 id="Nametag design">Nametag design</h2>
        <p>(Design period: 29th March 2021 ~ 29th March 2021)</p>
        <p>During the 1st day of "EA: 1st Hands-ON Session", we had to design a personalised name tag.</p>
        <P>Here is a run-down of the steps to design a nametag using Fusion360:</P>
        <img src="images/ea_nametag_fusion360_step1.png" class="nametag_step1" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>To begin sketching the layout, I drew a 50 mm by 20 mm rectangle by clicking on the “2-point rectangle” command and then typing the respective dimension values.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, I drew a tangent arc at the left-side of the rectangle and adjusted its dimension to 6.66 mm from the starting point by drawing a line and using the “Sketch dimension” command. I then drew a small circle next to the arc. However, a mistake I made as shown in the screenshot above is that when to sketch the inner part of the nametag as well.</p>
        <p>Through this mistake, I have learnt to sketch the parts that needs to be extruded first before sketching other parts that is to be extruded later.</p>

        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>As soon I clicked finish sketch, I clicked on the “Extrude” command and extruded the whole nametag by 3mm.</p>
        <img src="images/ea_nametag_fusion360_step3.png" class="nametag_step3" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>As a consequence to the mistake I made in step 1, I had to re-sketch the inner part of the nametag and extruded it by -2mm.</p>
        <img src="images/ea_nametag_fusion360_step4.png" class="nametag_step4" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>Next, I inserted my name onto the nametag by creating a new sketch and click on the “Text” command. I adjusted the size and position of my name and set it to bold and italics.</p>
        <img src="images/ea_nametag_fusion360_step5.png" class="nametag_step5" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>I extruded my name by 1 mm.</p>
        <img src="images/ea_nametag_fusion360_step6.png" class="nametag_step6" alt="">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <p>With that, I have completed designing the nametag using Fusion360.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Apart from the mistake I discussed earlier, I have also made another mistake whereby I design the nametag on a different axis.Therefore, rotation is required to view the side of the nametag with my name on it when viewing the design on Fusion360.</p>
        <p>Here is the design of the nametag:</p>

        <h2 id="Other Fusion360 projects">Other Fusion360 projects:</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of my other Fusion360 projects:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>1. Chess piece:</h3></li>
           <p>(Design period: 29th March 2021 ~ 30th March 2021)</p>
          <ul> 
            <li><h4>Documentation:</h4></li>
            <p>In this project, I used the “Revolve” command to form a 3D chess piece figure after sketching half of the chess piece. Afterwards, I drew a cylinder and adjusted the position of the cylinder using the “Move” command. With that, I extruded the cylinder to form a dent on the crown of the queen piece. To make the dent cover every side of the crown, I used the “Circular pattern” command. Finally, I used “Acetal Resin (white)” and “Base Material - Opaque”  for the body and base of the chess piece, respectively.</p>
            <li><h4>Experience:</h4></li>
            <p>Personally, I found experience of designing this chess piece to be  particularly fun as I enjoyed designing the chess piece  and I also found the chess piece to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
            <li><h4>Skills learnt:</h4></li>
            <p>I had learnt how and when to use the “Revolve” command to speed up my design process. For instance, I can use that command on symmetrical objects with a round base. I had also learnt to use the “Circular pattern” command to ensure the dents covered all sides.of circular surfaces.</p>
            <iframe src="https://ichat1616.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcf4b7dd0377712a053?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </ul>
          <li><h3>2. Sketch Ex03:</h3></li>
          <p>(Design period: 29th March 2021 ~ 29th March 2021)</p>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>Documentation:</h4></li>
            <p>In this project, I followed the dimensions of the figure on <a href="https://en.calameo.com/read/004987257fab6b0564037">Calaméo</a>. I extruded the “L-side” of the figure after sketching it. Afterwards, I sketched a large circle and a smaller circle. I extruded the upper-right formed by the 2 circles so that an arc is formed on the figure. Then, I sketched the smaller circle again and extruded the lower-half portion such that a hole is formed.	</p>
            <li><h4>Experience:</h4></li>
            <p>Overall, I found this project simple and I was able to complete it in a short period of time.</p>
            <iframe src="https://ichat1616.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcfae1239e13cf5e3d0?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </ul>
          <li><h3>3. Sketch Ex05:</h3></li>
          <p>(Design period: 29th March 2021 ~ 29th March 2021)</p>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>Documentation:</h4></li>
            <p>In this project, I also followed the dimensions of the figure from the same source and I extruded the flat base of the figure after sketching it. From there, I sketched the 2 base of the figure’s leg and extruded them according to their height. Afterwards, I sketched 2 circles of different sizes and extruded the upper ring of the formed by the two circles to form a ring. Same as Ex03, I sketched a smaller circle again and extruded the lower-half of it to form a hole.Finally, I repeat what I had done for the other leg.</p>
            <li><h4>Experience:</h4></li>
            <p>Overall I found this project simple eventhough it has slightly more steps to take to design the figure.</p>
            <iframe src="https://ichat1616.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcf9a4b4883aaba5f46?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </ul>
          <li><h3>4. Fidget spinner:</h3></li>
          <p>(Design period: 29th March 2021 ~ 29th March 2021)</p>
          <ul> 
          <li><h4>Documentation:</h4></li>
          <p>As for this project, I used several commands such as  “inscribe polygon”, “circular pattern” and “Tangent arc” to sketch the layout of the fidget spinner. After sketching, I extruded it and sketch another circle for the center part of the fidget spinner. I extruded the circle and use the “Fillet’ command on the sides of the fidget spinner. Finally, I applied “Gold-polished” for the appearance of the fidget spinner.</p>
          <li><h4>Experience:</h4></li>
          <p>I found this project interesting because I get to use several different commands to construct my design. The design process was not too complicated.</p>

        <p>After I had completed designing the nametag, I saved the file as STL format and imported it to Ultimaker Cura. I adjusted position of the nametag and the settings which were instructed by the lecturers. With that, I clicked the slice button and I saved the file for 3D printing. The 3D printer used is Ultimaker 2+.</p>
