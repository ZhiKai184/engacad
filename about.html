        <p>Hello there! I am Cheam Zhi Kai and I am from the Diploma in Engineering with Business (DEB) course. I am currently about to embark on my second year in SP and I also look forward to pushing my limits and go beyond in this prestigious EA programme!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 id="My hobbies">My hobbies</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of my hobbies:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>1. Watching Youtube videos:</h3></li>

          <p>I enjoy listening to songs & music and watch videos on Youtube during my free time.</p>
          <h3>2. Playing chess:</h3>

          <p>Ever since a friend of mine has introduced chess to me in November 2020, I have been playing over a hundred and fifty games on a physical board, Lichess and Chess.com combined. Chess is beautiful in many ways. One of them is that it has more possible moves than the number of atoms in the universe!</p>
          <h3>3. Reading books:</h3>
          <img src="/images/books.jpeg" class="books_image" alt="Books image">
          <figcaption>Photograph of my books</figcaption>
          <p>During school vacation, I would catch up on my reading journey by reading every day when I am free. The image above shows some examples of what I read.</p>
          <h3>4. Playing badminton:</h3>
          <img src="/images/badminton.jpeg" class="badminton_image" alt="Badminton image">
          <figcaption>Photograph of my badminton racket with a shuttlecock</figcaption>
          <p>Badminton has been one of my childhood fear as I was terrible at it. However, after playing this sport again in 2018, I started developing an interest in it and has been playing this sport with my friend whenever we are available! Though I am by no means an advanced player, badminton will always be a reminder of not to let our past defines us.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 id="Why am I in EA?">Why am I in EA?</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above in “Self-introduction”, I decided to join EA mainly because I want to push my limits and go beyond. During my secondary school days, I participated in several S.T.E.M. related competitions and have gained some insights and skills from them. I hope that I can learn new skills as well as more relevant hands-on experience to gain confidence and be better prepared for the working world.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I see the need to apply what I have learnt from not just my diploma course, but from “outside classroom” experience. Therefore, I believe that EA would help to quench my desire to learn new skills, apply what I have learnt,  and gain relevant hands-on experience.</p>
